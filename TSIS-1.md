#They Say I Say Chapter 1 Summary

##"They Say" - Starting with What Others are Saying

###MOTIVATION

To Give a point: "a writer needs to indicate clearly not only what his or her theisi is, but also what larger conversation that thesis is responding to"
Providing the proper context to an arguement allows the audience to better understand and contextualize it.
This is called reminding the audience of what "They Say"

Order: "a writer needs to explain what he or she is responding to--either before offering that response or, at least, very early in the discussion."
This better mimics that natural order of which information is synthesized. You always learn about something first before developing an idea about it.

When writing: "remeber that you are entering a conversation and therefore need to start with "what others are saying," ... then introduce your own ideas as a response. Specifically ... summarize what "they say" as soon as you can ... and remind readers of it at strategic points as your text unfolds."
Use what "they say" as a jumping off point for your writing. Since you need to introduce the reader to the source of your argument anyway, there's no reason not to use that same information later in your work to advance or prove your point.

To avoid listing everything: "as soon as possible [state] your own position and the one it's responding to i-together, and that you think of the two as a unit.
Avoid going to extremes when metioning your argument or waht it is based off of, one provides the foundation for the other so it's best to avoid building to big a foundation. 

Most important to show your reader's your motivation. The introduction serves to provide an example or meaning for what you are about to say.
