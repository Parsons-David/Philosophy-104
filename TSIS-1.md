#They Say I Say Chapter 1 Summary

##"They Say" - Starting with What Others are Saying

To Give a point: "a writer needs to indicate clearly not only what his or her theisi is, but also what larger conversation that thesis is responding to"
Providing the proper context to an arguement allows the audience to better understand and contextualize it.
This is called reminding the audience of what "They Say"

Order: "a writer needs to explain what he or she is responding to--either before offering that response or, at least, very early in the discussion."
This better mimics that natural order of which information is synthesized. You always learn about something first before developing an idea about it.
