# This Is Philosophy - Chapter 3 : 3.11 Summary

## Faith

###  Faith as Confidence

**Faith** - `an explanation of belief, confidence.`

Faith presupposes existence and does so without providing any evidence.

### Faith as Belief without Reason

**Faith** - `belief with out evidence or reason.`

    "Faith is more like wishful thinking than a path to knowledge."

---

On Faith:

    "One may certainly argue that there are limits to human understanding, or
    that there are truths beyond our capacity to know them. However, it’s a bit
    peculiar to argue that there are matters beyond the reach of reason and
    then turn around and claim to know the truth about these very matters."

**Natural Theory** - `using reason to evaluate claims of the divine`.

## The Attributes of God

Why These are Important to Know:

    "Before we can begin examining whether there is a God, we must first have
    some conception of what God is. If we have no idea who or what God could be,
    then we’ll have no idea if we actually run across him, her, or it ... whether
    God truly exists is independent from the issue of what God’s qualities or
    properties are."

God is Said to Be:

  *Omnipotent* - all powerful   
  *Omniscient* - all knowing  
  *Omnibenevolent* - morally perfect or perfectly good

    "If we can demonstrate the existence of any being that is omnipotent,
    omniscient, and omnibenevolent, then we have proven the existence of God."

Otherwise we have proven that God does not exist.
