# This Is Philosophy - Chapter 4 : 4.24 Summary

## Freedom

**Free Will** - Your will is free just in case you can choose to perform one action instead of another.

### Divine Foreknowledge Why There is No Free Will, Part 1

    "Philosophers and theologians have been troubled since the Middle Ages
     that if there is an omniscient God, then free will seems impossible"

If God knows everything, then he knows what will happen in the future, therefore the future is already determined, so we cannot change the future, therefore we have no free will.

Presentation of the Problem of Divine Foreknowledge Argument
    1. Assume there is an omniscient God. (premise)
    2. If God is omniscient, then he infallibly knows
       every fact about the past, present, and future.
    3. Therefore, God infallibly knows every fact
       about the past, present, and future.
    4. Therefore, God infallibly knows everything that you will do, every action
       you will perform, and everything that will happen to you.
    5. If God infallibly knows everything that you will do, then it is impossible
       for you to do anything other than what God knows you will do; you have no
       choice.
    6. Therefore, you have no choice in what you will do.
    7. If you have no choice in what you will do, then you are not free.
    8. Therefore, you have no free will.

#### Objection 1: Atheism and Agnosticism

Reject the presence of God or refuse to have an opinion. Or admit that God is not omniscient

#### Objection 2: Aristotle's Answer

Aristotle argued: there are no facts about the future.

    "no statement about the future is either true or false"

If this is true than premise 2 is false and God's omniscience does not extend into the future.

### A Regress of Reasons for Acting Why There is No Free Will, Part 2

There's a reasons behind every decision that you make.

#### Previous Decisions vs. Outside Forces

What influenced the reasoning behind your decision and why?

**Previous Decisions** Your reasons for acting are the result of some previous decisions you made.

**Outside Forces** Your reasons for acting somehow came from forces and influences outside of your mind (for example: authority, family, society, environment, or innate biological instincts).

    "your biology, experiences, upbringing, and environment determine [the weight of
     your reasons for making decisions]. The important thing to notice here is that
     all of these forces are outside of your control and not the result of your choosing."

The regress of reasons argument against free will
     1. You always act according to your greatest desire.
     2. Your desires and their relative strengths are outside of your control.
     3. Therefore your actions are outside of your control.
     4. If your actions are outside of your control, then they are not the result
        of your choices.
     5. Therefore your actions are not the result of your choices.
     6. If your actions are not the result of your choices, then you have no free will.
     7. Therefore, you have no free will.

#### The Digger Wasp

Humans have been show to make similar decisions.

    "if no two individuals behave in precisely the same way in the same circumstance,
     this is no proof at all that our actions are free or not determined by natural
     forces"
---
    "Consider two leaves falling from a tree: no two fall in exactly the same way.
     However, this hardly means that leaves freely decide how to fallâ€”obviously their
     falling patterns are the result of differences in the wind, subtle variations
     in the shape of the leaves, and so on, all physical facts that have nothing to
     do with willing."

We're just more complex stinger wasps, programmed by natural selection.
