### A Regress of Reasons for Acting Why There is No Free Will, Part 3

#### The Threat of Determinism

*A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities*:

    "All we need is a snapshot of the universe, one so finely detailed that we
     could tell the position and momentum of every particle, and we could in
     principle figure out the entire future history of the universe and everything
     in it."

**Determinism** - given the laws of nature and a set of initial conditions, there is exactly one physically possible future.

    "The initial conditions of the universe are the physical facts at the moment
     of the Big Bang. Those facts, coupled with the laws of physics, determine
     everything that has happened since. The universe is simply in the process
     of unfolding"

**Incompatibilism** - Either we have no free will or determinism is false.

#### Will Randomness Make Us Free?

    "If an action is undetermined, if it occurs randomly, then its happening is
     a matter of chance or luck, and not a free action. The whole idea behind free
     will, as we have defined it, is that we have a choice in what we do, that we
     have a sort of volitional control over our thoughts and actions. But random
     actions aren’t under the control of anything."

#### The Dilemma Argument Against Free Will

    1. Either determinism is true, or it is false. (trivial)
    2. If determinism is true, then you can never choose to perform one action
       instead of another.
    3. If you can never choose to perform one action instead of another, then
       you do not have free will.
    4. Therefore, if determinism is true, no one has free will.
    5. If determinism is false, then some events are random (those not random
       are determined).
    6. If you do something randomly, then it is not the result of choice.
    7. Therefore, an action that is random is not the result of free will.
    8. Therefore, if determinism is false, there is no free will.
    9. Therefore, there is no free will. (from 1, 2–4, 5–8)

#### Free Will and Moral Responsibility

    "See, if you’re not free, then there was never anything else you could do,
     no matter what you do. Either forces outside of your control determine
     every action you perform, in which case you never had a choice, or your
     actions are the result of randomness, in which case you never had a choice.
     Either way, you were never free to do anything differently; there was nothing
     you could have done to produce a different outcome."

*The Principle of Alternate Possibilities* - you are morally responsible for an action x only if at the time you did x, there was alternate possible action y that you could have done instead.

    "Therefore the Zorg scenario is a case in which someone is morally responsible
     for an action, despite the fact that at the time the action was performed
     there was no alternate possible action that she could have done instead.
     Thus the principle of alternate possibilities is false. The existence of a
     possible alternative action to what one actually did is not a requirement
     for moral responsibility."

*Frankfurt* - `one is not morally responsible for what one does if one does it only because one could not have done otherwise.`

#### Agent Causation

**Agent Causation** - the alternative to determinism isn’t randomness at all, but our own free will.

##### Objection 1: Mystery

    "either your reasons for acting are due to causal forces outside of you, you
     have an infinite chain of reasons for acting to do anything, or your reasons
     are random and not the exercise of free will."

##### Objection 2: Magic

    "Agent causation insists upon a sort of causation that is connected to the rest
     of the physical world in a most peculiar way ... the universe does not
     leave its mark upon us, but we can leave our mark upon it. Surely for agent
     causation our choosing is beyond the reach of science to treat; there can be
     no psycho-physical laws or rigorous predictions of our behavior. We are
     magicians, casting spells, with causal powers outside the domain of science."

#### Compatibilism

**Libertarian Free Will** - Your will is free just in case you can choose to perform one action instead of another.

**Compatibilist Free Will**: Your performance of an action is free just in case it is the result of your beliefs, desires, and intentions.

##### Objection 1: Too Little Freedom

    "Compatibilism [means] that the plain ordinary facts about the world imply
     that we’re still not free."

##### Objection 2: Too Much Freedom

    "cases where we are intuitively unfree come out as free action under
     compatibilism .... compatibilism then looks absurdly inclusive—everything you
     do is free, no matter what. You’re every bit as free in prison as you are
     on the outside."

### The Feeling of Freedom

    "It turns out there is a difference in the brain between a freely voluntary
     act, such as you consciously lifting your arm, and involuntary motions, such
     as your arm jerking up as a result of cerebral palsy, Parkinsonism,
     Huntington’s chorea, Tourette’s, etcetera."
