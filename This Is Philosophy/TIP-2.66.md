# This Is Philosophy - Chapter 2.66 : End Summary

## Virtue Ethics (Is Morality All about Having a Virtuous Character?)

	"Instead of obsessing about good actions, we ought to
	focus on what it is to be a good person."

**Immanuel Kent**:

The two central components of virtue ethics:
	the concept of virtue,
	the concept of character.

A good person is a virtuous person, one with a certain sort of character.

### What is virtue?

**Virtues** are: `good qualities or characteristics.`

	"Being a virtuous person assures that you are doing the best that
	you can and that you are living the best life possible given whatever
	situation you are in."

Varying from *Utilitarianism* in that the consequences of your actions don't define your morality. Instead your motivations and attempts are a more defining aspect of virtue.

	"The opposite of virtue is vice."
