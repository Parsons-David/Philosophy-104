# This Is Philosophy - Chapter 1 Summary

## The Normative Universe

*The Normative Universe* is made up of shoulds, oughts,
duties, rights, the permissible and the impermissible.

## Is Morality Just Acting on Principles?

**Golden Rule** - do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

Well, the Golden Rule implicitly *assumes* that **everyone has the same preferences**. That assumption seems a bit questionable. Suppose that you like backrubs. In fact, *you’d like a backrub from pretty much anyone*. The Golden Rule advises you to treat other people the way you would like to be treated. Since you’d like other people to give you unsolicited backrubs, *you should, according to the Golden Rule, give everyone else a backrub, even if they didn’t ask for one*. **But some people don’t like backrubs**, or don’t care for strangers touching them. Intuitively, *it would be wrong to give backrubs to those people without their consent, or against their will*. Since this intuition conflicts with the Golden Rule’s implication to administer unsolicited backrubs, we should conclude that maybe the Golden Rule is really iron pyrite after all.

## The Divine Command Theory

**Divine Command Theory Premises**

    1. God loves (endorses, recommends, advocates) all good actions
    and hates (forbids, abjures, prohibits) all evil actions.

    2. We can figure out which is which; that is, we can know what
    God loves and what he hates.

**Euthyphro Argument/Objection**

*Option A*

    "Things are good because God loves them. This means that it is
    God’s love that makes things good, and his dislike that makes
    things bad. Prior to, or considered independently of, God’s
    judgment, things don’t have moral qualities at all. If it weren’t
    for God, nothing would be right or wrong, good or bad. Moral
    properties are the result of God’s decisions"

*Option B*

    "God loves good things because they are good. On this option,
    things are good (or bad) antecedently to, and independently of,
    God. In other words, things already have their moral properties,
    and God, who is an infallible judge of such matters, always loves
    the good things and hates the bad things. Morality is an
    independent objective standard apart from God. God always responds
    appropriately to this standard (loving all the good stuff and
    hating the bad), but morality is separate from, and unaffected by,
    his judgments."

This objection asks which of the following options is true. And if option A is true, then God's judgment is entirely objective, and therefore so is morality, under the divine command theory. If option B is true, then following God's judgment is pointless, since things are already good and bad independent of him. Morality is then therefore indepent of God.

Under Option A: *morality is random and arbitrary.*

    "So there is no moral reason for God to declare murder wrong
    instead of right. morality is completely arbitrary; the fact that
    rape and murder are immoral is random. God could have just as
    easily made rape and murder your moral duty. What’s to stop him?
    He’s God after all"

Under Option B: *morality and religion are logically separate*

    "God loves things because they are good. That is, God’s judgments
    flawlessly track moral reality; he invariably loves the good and
    hates the wicked. God may be a perfect judge, but he does not
    make the moral law. In other words, morality and religion are
    logically separate, which means that whether God exists has
    nothing to do with whether there are moral facts or what those
    facts are."
