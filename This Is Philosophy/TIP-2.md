# This Is Philosophy - Chapter 2 : 2.36 Summary

## Utiliarianism (Is Morality Doing What I can to Make This the Best World Possible?)

Utilitarianism aims to address the problem of equal treatment that was presented in moral and cultural relativism.
    
    "A moral theory that treats everyone equally, without prejudice to personal standing"
    
Focuses on the outcomes of actions.

	"Provides an answer to every moral question ... [sometimes] not obvious, 
    utilitarianism still provides the means to answer them.

### Consequentialism and Hedonism

*Consequentialism:*
		
    All that morally matters is the consequences of action.

From the perspective of morality, all that matters is
what you actually did. To find out whether you did the right thing or the wrong thing, all we need to do is look at the consequences of your action.

	"[The] thing you decide to do should be whatever has the best consequences."
    
and

	"you have to consider the consequences for everyone affected by your action,
    not just now, but indefinitely into the future

But, **consequentialism can’t be correct**, there
must be more to morality than just consequences alone.

**Summum Bonum** - a theory of the highest good or what the aim of morality really is.

`Consequentialism + the highest good is pleasure = hedonistic utilitarianism`

	"[Y]ou should always do the best you can; whatever action will produce the best
	balance of pleasure over pain for everyone your action affects (including you)"

In the event no available options can produce pleasure:
	
    "The utilitarian judgment is to choose the lesser of two evils"

### Measuring Pains and Pleasures

**Bentham’s Felicific Calculus**

	1. Intensity:
		How powerful or intense is the pleasure or pain? Some pleasures are mild,
		like a tasty apple. Some are great, like the joy of graduation, or a wedding.
		Some pains are mild, like a papercut, others are strong, like a migraine
		headache.
	2. Duration
		How long will the pain or pleasure last? Obviously, you want pains to be
		brief and pleasures to be long lasting.
	3. Certainty or uncertainty
		How likely is it that the possible pain or pleasure that we’re considering really
		will occur? An action with a high likelihood of pleasure to follow and a very
		low risk of pain looks like a better choice, all other things being equal, than
		an action with a low chance of pleasure and a high risk of pain. When you’re
		playing cards, bet high on good hands.
	4. Propinquity or remoteness
		How soon is the pain or pleasure? Is it going to happen right away, or is
		it years in the distance? The pleasures of education may be a long time
		coming—learning to play guitar is a slow process, and the joy of mastery is
		remote in time. The pleasure of an afternoon nap is imminent. The further
		away a sensation is, the more intervening factors there may be that prevent
		it, and so the less likely it is that it will ever happen.
	5. Fecundity
		A sensation is fecund just in case it tends to be followed by the same type of
		sensation. For example, the pleasure of learning to read tends to lead to other
		pleasures, such as reading a good book. So the pleasure of learning to read
		is fecund. The pain of food poisoning often follows the unpleasantness of
		eating bad seafood, so the latter is a fecund pain. Clearly you would prefer
		your pleasures to be fecund and your pains not.
	6. Purity
		A sensation is impure just in case it tends to be followed by the opposite type
		of sensation, otherwise it is pure. For example, drinking a lot of alcohol is
		an impure pleasure, since it tends to be followed by the pain of a hangover.
		Working out at the gym is an impure pain since it tends to be followed by
		the pleasure of fitness. So you should want your pleasures to be pure and
		your pains impure.
	7. Extent
		How many people will be affected by your action? To what extent will the
		pains or pleasures produced by your behavior spread out to other people?
		Those have to be taken into account and added up too.
---
	Again, you needn’t work through the felicific calculus every time you act.
	But it is there, waiting in the wings, for those problematic cases in which
	it’s not obvious what the right action and the optimal consequences
	really are.

### Quality and Quantity

Bentham:

	"It is just pompous moralizing to declaim [that] pleasure is somehow superior in
     any way other than its amount."
    
---

	As one becomes more informed and more expert about any subject—food, antiques, 
    literature,	tennis racquets, movies, travel, romantic trysts, jazz, or Platonic 
    dialogues one gains a finer appreciation for the high end while losing the ability
    to be satisfied with the low end.
---
    "The recognition of quality comes at a cost."
The Millian View:

	"We should live our lives like Jane Pivo—we should become knowledgeable about various
	 pleasures, pursuing and promoting them."

But:

	"The appreciation of high quality pleasures is certainly
	 worthwhile when the cost of gaining those pleasures is low."
    
Summary Example:

	"There is no point in loading up on the Jell-O with mini marshmallows when one could
     have the lobster instead."
