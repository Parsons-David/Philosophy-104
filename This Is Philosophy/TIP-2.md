# This Is Philosophy - Chapter 2 : 2.36 Summary

## Utiliarianism (Is Morality Doing What I can to Make This the Best World Possible?)

Utilitarianism aims to address the problem of equal treatment that was presented in moral and cultural relativism.
    
    "A moral theory that treats everyone equally, without prejudice to personal standing"
    
Focuses on the outcomes of actions.

	"Provides an answer to every moral question ... [sometimes] not obvious, 
    utilitarianism still provides the means to answer them.

### Consequentialism and Hedonism

*Consequentialism:*
		
    All that morally matters is the consequences of action.

From the perspective of morality, all that matters is
what you actually did. To find out whether you did the right thing or the wrong thing, all we need to do is look at the consequences of your action.

	"[The] thing you decide to do should be whatever has the best consequences."
    
and

	"you have to consider the consequences for everyone affected by your action,
    not just now, but indefinitely into the future

But, **consequentialism canâ€™t be correct**, there
must be more to morality than just consequences alone.

**Summum Bonum** - a theory of the highest good or what the aim of morality really is.

`Consequentialism + the highest good is pleasure = hedonistic utilitarianism`

	"[Y]ou should always do the best you can; whatever action will produce the best
	balance of pleasure over pain for everyone your action affects (including you)"

In the event no available options can produce pleasure:
	
    "The utilitarian judgment is to choose the lesser of two evils"
