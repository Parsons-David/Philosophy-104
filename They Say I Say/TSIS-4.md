# They Say I Say - Chapter 4 Summary

## "Yes/ No/ Okay, But"
Three Ways to Respond

### Quoting with Purpose

    "the 'I say' stage, in which you offer your own argument as a response to
    what 'they' have said."

Most common ways to respond to others ideas:

    1. Agreeing
    2. Disagreeing
    3. Some Combination of 1 and 2

### Only Three Ways to Respond?

It can be important to avoid overly complex writing in order to prevent departing from conventional ways of thinking and making it more difficult for the reader to fully comprehend your argument.

Start simplictically so that the reader can easily understand what you mean with things like:

    I agree that ____, but I cannot agree that _____.

    "the best interpretations take strong stands relative to other interpretations"

### Disagree - And Explain Why

It's not enought to just disagree with something. You have to take it a step further and contribute someting new to your disagreement.

    "To turn [a disagreement] into an argument, you need to give reasons to support
    what you say"

If something presented is overly obvious, then you can use the *"duh"* approach:

    "You can even disagree by making [the "duh"] move, in which you disagree not
    with the position itself but with the assumption that it is a new or stunning
    revelation."

More directly put, if you find yourself thinking "No Shit" then say it:

    "X presents Y, but of course we all know X."

### Templates for Disagreeing, with reasons

    X is mistaken beacuse she overlooks ____.
    X's claim that ____ rests upon the questionable assumption that _____.
    I disagree with X's view that ____ becuase, as recent research has shown,  ____.
    X contradicts herself/can't have it both ways. On the one hand, she argues
      _____. On the other hand, she also says ____.
    By focusing on _____, X overlooks the deeper problem of _____.

It's better to state your disagreements in "frank and considerate ways", rather than avoiding making them at all.

### Agree - But with a Difference

    "Even as you're agreeing, it's important to bring something new and fresh to the
    table, adding something that makes you a valuable participant in the conersation."

Even if you agree with something, there are lots of ways for you to contribute to the conversation.

### Templates for Agreeing

    I agree that _____ because my experience _____ confirms it.
    X is surely right about _____ becuase, as she may not be aware, recent studies
      have shown that _____.
    X's theory of _____ is extremly useful because it sheds light on the difficult
      problem of _____.
    Those unfamiliar with this school of thought may be interested to know that it
      basically boils down to _____.
    I agree that _____, a point that needs emphasizing since so many people still
      believe _____.
    If group X is right that _____, as I think they are, then we need to reassess
      the popular assumption that _____.

### Agree and Disagree Simultanesously

    "agreeing and disagreeing simultanesously [helps] us get beyond the kind of 'is
    too' / 'is not' exchanges that of characterize the disputes of young children
    and the more polarized shouting matches of talk radio and TV."

      that _____.
