# They Say I Say - Chapter 2 Summary

##"Her Point Is"
The Art of Summarizing

### Put Yourself in Their Shoes
    "[When summarizing play the] "believing hame," in which you try to inhabit the worldview of
    those whose conversation you are joining ... and try to see ... their prespective"
It's important to properly summarize what "They Say" and the most effective summaries only paint the original authors view. The reader should only be able to distinguish the original authors ideas from your summary.

    "If [you cannot suspend your own views] you are likely to produce summaries that are so
    obviously biased that they undermine your credibility with readers"
It's important to allow your reader to develop their own view of what you are summarizing before being exposed to yours.

### Know Where You are Going
    "A good summary ... has a foucs or spin that allows the summary to fit with your own agenda
    while still being true to the text you are summarizing."
While it's important to not let your own ideas influence how you summarize, it is effective to let your ideas frame what your summarize.
    
    "Writing a good summary means not just representing an author's view accurately, but doing 
    to in a way that fits your own compositions larger agneda."

### Summarizing Satirically
    "[When] a writer deliberately gives his or her own spin to someone else's arguement in order
    to reveal a glaring shortcoming in it."
Allows the writers to use a summary of what ther original author wrote to find contradictions or discrepensies without providing their own analysis. Like on "The Daily Show".

### Signal Verbs
    "To do just to the authors you cit ... use vivid an precise signal verbs as often as possible."
    
Bland introductions of summaries can undermine the tone of what the auhor originally said and take away from the action that your are trying to introduce.
