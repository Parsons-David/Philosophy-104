##"As He Himself Puts It"
The Art of Quoting

### Quoting with Purpose

    "Quoting someone else's words gives a tremendous amount of credibility to your summary and helps
    ensure that it is fair and accurate. In a [sense quotations] function as a kind of proof of evidence.

Providing context to your argument by giving a summary can be very effective, but is strengthed if you provide evidence that you truly understand what you are summarizing by providing a quote.

    "Quoting what "They Say" must always be connected to with what "You Say".

### Quote Relevant Passages
    
    "Be careful not to select quotations just for the sake of demonstrating that you've read the
    author's work; you need to make sure they support your own argument."

Quotes aren't mean't to just provide some extra bits to top off an essay. They can either be an intregral part of your arguement, providing you with effective support, or they will cause your writing to appear sloppy if placed introduced at the wrong times.

### Frame Every Quotation
    
    "Quotations do not speak for themselevs, you need to build a frame around them in which you
    [speak] for them."

Introducing and not addressing a quote not only wastes your time as a writer, but it also wastes your readers time, making it far more difficult for them to fully comprehend your arguement. "Dangling" quotations are introduced with no explanation for why they are presented. Such quotations aren't viewed with any importance and contribute very little to the piece they are in.

### Can You Overanalyze a Quotation?

    "When in doubt, go for it. It is better to risk being overly exlicit about what you take a 
    quotation to mean than to leave the quotation dangling and your readers in doubt."
