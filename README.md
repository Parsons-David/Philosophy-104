# Philosophy 104 Notes and Review
This repository is mean't to serve as a home for the notes and chapter reviews that I take during Introduction to Philosophy at Rutgers University.

I've written chapter summaries on the book **They Say I Say** by *Gerald Graff* and Cathy Birkenstein, based off of my synthesis of the material I read. I mostly summarize what I found to be most important while reading and what I whould find useful to review when studying later.

The repo also includes chapter summaries and notes on the textbook **This is Philosopy: A Introduction** by *Steven D. Hales*.

I may additionaly include any arguement maps or other work that I develop during my time taking this course.
