# Philosophy 104 Notes and Review
This repository is mean't to serve as a home for the notes and chapter reviews that I take during Introduction to Philosophy at Rutgers University.

I've written chapter summaries based off of my synthesis of the material I read. I mostly summarize what I found to be most important while reading and what I whould find useful to review when studying later.

Course Materials:

   **They Say I Say** by *Gerald Graff & Cathy Birkenstein*   
   **This is Philosopy: A Introduction** by *Steven D. Hales*

I may additionaly include any arguement maps or other work that I develop during my time taking this course.
